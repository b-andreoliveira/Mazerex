# Mazerex

This GitHub page is dedicated to documenting the deleoping process of Mazerex.

For the Internship II report of the MSc Neuroscinces, please go to the 'final' folder, as it contains the final version of the codes and the 3D-printable files.

The python script running in both RaspberryPi I and RaspberryPi II is the same.
